    <h3>Message from PRINCIPAL</h3>
    <p>It is both an honour and a privilege to step into the interim role of Principal at GEC Idukki. I am happy to note the remarkable progress the institute has made over the years. infrastructure, Our robust academic well-equipped buildings, state-of-the-art laboratories, and facilities feature in a beautiful rural area, GEC Idukki offers a unique blend of tranquillity and opportunity for academic excellence. While our location presents particular challenges, it also provides a strong sense of community and a peaceful environment that fosters innovation and learning. As we look ahead, I am confident we can raise GEC Idukki to even greater heights with the collective strength, experience, and expertise we have gained over the past 25 years. I have observed the unwavering commitment and expertise of our strong faculty and staff at GEC Idukki, whose dedication continues to shape the success and growth of our institution. Together, we will strive to set new standards in technical education and continue making meaningful contributions to our community and society. 
Best Wishes,<br>
